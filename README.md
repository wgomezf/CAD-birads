A comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis system based on the BI-RADS lexicon for mammographic masses

We propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the classification of mammographic masses based on the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). This CAD involves two main stages:

1. From morphological and texture features, the categorical attributes of the BI-RADS lexicon for masses are predicted: shape (round, oval, lobular, and irregular), margin (not spiculated and spiculated), and density (fatty, glandular, dense).

2. These categorical outcomes are used as features to predict the likelihood of malignancy of the tumor.
